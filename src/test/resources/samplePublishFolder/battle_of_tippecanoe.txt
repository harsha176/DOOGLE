The Battle of Tippecanoe was fought on November 7, 1811, between U.S. forces led by Governor William Henry Harrison and warriors of a Native American confederation led by Shawnee brothers Tenskwatawa (pictured) and Tecumseh. While Tecumseh was away recruiting allies, Harrison marched with about 1,000 men to disperse the confederation's headquarters at Prophetstown, near the confluence of the Tippecanoe and Wabash Rivers in what is now the U.S. state of Indiana. The outnumbered warriors from Prophetstown launched a surprise attack, but Harrison's army prevailed. Public opinion in the United States blamed the conflict on British interference, a suspicion that served as a catalyst to the War of 1812. When the U.S. declared war on Great Britain in June 1812, Tecumseh's confederacy, now allied with the British, initiated its own war against the United States
